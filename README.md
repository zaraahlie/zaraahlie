### 👋 Hey there, I'm Zara!

Currently I'm focusing on my lifelong obsession with design by transferring my skills to UI design! You can probably find me on Figma most of the day for that reason. 👀 🖌️

- 🎨 I'm working on getting my **personal website** setup (I need my brain to agree on a design first)
- 👩🏽‍💻 I'm learning about **React.js** to utilize on a project I'm working on with a team
- 🔎 I'm always looking to volunteer my skills at **non-profits**
- 💬 Ask me about **my projects**, including my readability analyzer, Razara Movie Database, and Battlehauz

***

Outside of projects and design, I'm an average second-year computer science trying to get an internship for summer 2022. ☀️ I just so happen to also have an obsession with watermelon and K-Dramas. 🍉 

I'm always down to connect, so reach out on LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaraahlie/)! 🤠
