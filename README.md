### 👋 Hey there, I'm Zara!

Currently I'm focusing on my lifelong obsession with design transferring my skills to UI design! You can probably find me on Figma most of the day for that reason. 👀

- I'm working on getting my personal website setup (I need my brain to agree on a design first)
- I'm learning about React.js and working with a team on a project that uses it
- I'm always looking to volunteer my skills at non-profits 
- Ask me about my projects, including my readability analyzer, Razara Movie Database, and Battlehauz

Outside of my team projects and design, I'm an average second-year computer science trying to get an internship for summer 2022.
