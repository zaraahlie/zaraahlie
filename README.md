### 👋 Hey there, I'm Zara!

Currently, I'm focusing on my lifelong obsession by practicing UI design! You can probably find me on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/gssi4oeT1G4zOpMhXrgap4/Portfolio?node-id=2%3A649) for that reason. 👀 🖌️

- 🎨 I'm working on getting my **personal website** setup (I need my brain to agree on a design first)
- 👩🏽‍💻 I'm learning about **React.js** to utilize on a project I'm working on with a team
- 🔎 I'm always looking to work on projects for **non-profits**
- 💬 Ask me about my **readability analyzer, Razara Movie Database, and Battlehauz**

***

Outside of projects and design, I'm a third-year computer science student currently on co-op as a PL/SQL developer at Employment Social Development Canada. I just so happen to also have an obsession with watermelon and Marvel movies. 🍉 

I'm always down to connect, so reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaraahlie/)! 🤠
